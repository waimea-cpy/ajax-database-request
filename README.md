Demo of JavaScript AJAX database request and response handling

The home page shows a list of pets obtained from the database. Each one has an onClick function call, passing on the id of the pet.

The JS function sets up and send off an AJAX request for more info. Upon receiving the info, the data is placed into the details div via DOM manipulation.
